# FBI Incidents Analysis

## Welcome!

Welcome, SkillsBuild learner, and congratulations on making it to the project-based learning section of the Cyber Tackles Trafficking learning plan. 
So, what is this project all about? 
While the main goal is to get you some hands-on experience working with a real human trafficking dataset (while not requiring any coding expertise), you’ll also get experience navigating GitHub; use Terminal or Command Line to lay the groundwork for data analysis; and become more comfortable using Python and Jupyter Notebook to explore and visualize a dataset. 
There are no right or wrong answers, no assessment, and this data analysis project doesn’t build directly off of what you learned in SkillsBuild (though it’ll certainly help that you went through those courses). It’s more about exploration and discovery. Also, don’t worry if this is your first time using Python or Jupyter Notebook. 

*Jupyter Notebook is a free web application where you can work with data (cleaning, visualization, etc.), while receiving guidance directly within the coding interface.
